## 1.1 Participants

Oracle, Ericsson, EURECOM, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Intel, Internet Research Institute, The Paciello Group, Panasonic, SmartThings/Samsung Research, Siemens, Technical University of Munich(TUM)

# 2. Evaluation on checking points in Prague plugfest

## 2.1 Connect with remote/local proxy (narrow waist model)

![connect with proxies](images/diagram01.png)

### Fujitsu
 Â  We provide one remote proxy in Nagoya and two local proxies.
   One local proxy is placed in Smart Home in Japan, and three devices(LED Light, AirConditioner, Blind) connect it by ECHONET Lite.
   Another local proxy is placed in PlugFest Place, and two devices(Rotating Light, Brightness Sensor) connect it.
   And our application(node-red) connect remote proxy and control devices.

### Hitachi
   It is useful for application developer (on the Internet) to aggregate all local device servient access.

### Panasonic
   Both Application Servients and Device Servients are successfully connected to Fujitsu remote/local proxy.

## 2.2 Application servient

![application servient](images/diagram02.png)

### Fujitsu
   We use Node-RED to lookup TD and set/get property value and Action.
   Nimura-san use scripting api.

### Hitachi
   Our Servients are example of "minimal Servient implementations", which is mentioned in [the Architecture document](https://w3c.github.io/wot-architecture/#application).  We can easily connect to WoT device using IoT tools that support HTTP REST API call.
   It might be a good idea to check connectivity of other existing IoT tools for broader adoption of WoT.
   And also, it may be better to mention legacy *applications* (i.e. existing, commonly-used IoT tools) connectivity in the Architecture document, same as legacy *devices*.

### Panasonic
   Supported both Scripting App and NodeRED
   Future work: cross domain scenario (home, mobility, social infrastructure, etc) with meaningful scenario.

## 2.3 Connect with node-wot

### Fujitsu
   (future work)

### Hitachi
   (future work)

### Panasonic
   (future work)

## 2.4 Scripting API

![scripting api](images/diagram04.png)

### Fujitsu
   (Nimura-san will insert here)

### Hitachi 
   (future work)

### Panasonic
   Support Consumed Thing in JavaScript scripting API.
   (Exposed Thing not supported)

## 2.5 Thing Directory 

![Thing Directory](images/diagram05.png)

### Fujitsu
   We provide simple one. Application Servients can lookup TDs by specifying the device's name.

### Hitachi
   We just crawl all TDs in Fujitsu's directory.  Using search functions from application servient is future work.

### Panasonic
   Did not provide directory by ourselves.
   Registered and retrieved TDs to/from Fujitsu's directory through a tool (Advanced REST Client and POSTMAN).
   Future work: Automatic registration when starting WoT Server; Integrated retrieval from WoT Client.

## 2.6 Many kinds of device servients

![device servients](images/diagram06.png)

### Fujitsu
   Local Devices: Rotary Beacon Light(connectet by EtherCAT) and Brightness Sensor(connectet by BLE)
   Remote Devices(in Japan): LED Light, Blind and Airconditioner (connected by Echonet LITE)

### Hitachi
   Our application only collect properties on each devices.  Not yet utilized each characteristic of device.
   Utilizing them based on semantic annotations is future work.

### Panasonic
   Several Local and Remote Device Servients are provided (See 2.4.4)


## 2.7 Device simulators

![device simulators](images/diagram10.png)

### Fujitsu
   (future work)

### Hitachi
   (future work)

### Panasonic
   Device Simulator works on Raspberry-Pi, PC and cloud.


## 2.8 Semantic discovery

![semantic discovery](images/diagram07.png)

### Fujitsu
   (future work)

### Hitachi
   (future work)

### Panasonic
   Some TDs support semantic annotation.
   Future work: Application using semantic discovery with meaningful scenario.

## 2.9 Security

![security accessibility](images/diagram08.png)

### Fujitsu
   We use bearer token for access the remote/local proxy.
   And also use bearer token between remote proxy and local proxy.

### Hitachi
   We used bearer token for access the remote proxy.  The token is received by a mail and is included in configuration file by hand.  These process is needed to improve using more sophisticated manner (e.g. OAuth etc.)

### Panasonic
   HTTPS and bearer token are supported
   Future work: Authentication

## 2.10 Accessibility

![security accessibility](images/diagram08.png)

### Fujitsu
   (future work)

### Hitachi
   (future work)

### Panasonic
   (future work)


## 2.11 Event handling with long polling

![event handling](images/diagram09.png)

### Fujitsu
   Our Remote and Local proxy support SSE and Long Polling.
   Brightness Sensor support long polling

### Hitachi
   (future work)

### Panasonic
   Supported by some Device Servients (Air-conditioner and Lighting on Simulator)


# 3. Issues for the next plugfest

## 3.1 followings should be improved for next:
- Use the same schema between members
- Security
- Accessibility

## 3.2 Thing directory will be specified more detail
- Two different interfaces provided by Siemens and Fujitsu
- Directory interface should be specified
- Roles of directory and proxy should be specified in Fujitsu proxy
## 3.3 Web browser as a WoT Servient will be connected
- Fujitsu and Panasonic implemented 

## 3.4 Collecting TD and servient information should be needed
- Please upload your TDs to github and give some explanation of your servients.

## 3.5 Network topology variations
- Collect use cases of network topology.

## 3.6 Interface between servients
- Specify interface and sequence diagram
- Describe these in appendix of Architecture document.

## 3.7 Meta applications

## 3.8 CORS issue when using Scripting app on browser. (inserted by Panasonic)
- To be accessed by browser through XMLHTTPRequest, WoT Servients need to add "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * " header in it's response to the requests including OPTIONS method.

## 3.9 Multiple "form" issue when using Fujitsu proxy (inserted by Panasonic)
- Fujitsu proxy currently does not support multiple "form" for one property.
- In Panasonic TD, "read/write" and "observe" to a same property is expressed as two different HTTP endpoints
  ->changes to two different property were necessary.
